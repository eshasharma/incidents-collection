Political Loyalty (or Lack of It) in the Tell-All Era

Late in the new book “Game Change,” a chronicle of the 2008 presidential campaign that has much of Washington cringing and the rest of the country gasping, comes a scene that may not match others for pure titillation but has an eerie, pitiable resonance all its own.

Chip Litherland for The New York Times
ALL EARS The Giulianis aloft in 2008.                            




As the book tells it, Judith Giuliani, whose husband, Rudolph, was still in the race, summoned his counselors to a New York restaurant to plot the buffing of her image. She christened them Team J. And in advance of their advice, she demanded their signatures, presenting them with nondisclosure agreements that swore them to secrecy.		
That gesture, it now seems, was as futile as it was clumsy. But it pegs Mrs. Giuliani — whose spokeswoman professed no awareness of the meal or meeting — as an aptly cynical analyst of today’s political culture, in which the loyalty of aides should never, ever be taken for granted.		
A compendium of secrets spilled by intimates ducking behind a veil of anonymity, “Game Change,” by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, is also a bracing testament to the potential foolishness of trust and the rareness of discretion. Together with previous reporting on a particularly heated presidential contest, it sows strong doubts about whether, when and how politicians today can hope to command fidelity.		
“As a guy who is three-quarters Sicilian, I can say that the code of political omerta is now dead,” said Chris Lehane, a former adviser to Bill Clinton and Al Gore. “There are just different standards out there, and I don’t think it’s limited to politics.”		
Mr. Lehane’s assessment was echoed by other political advisers, current and former. They said that a range of factors — a general coarsening of American culture, a lust for attention, the movement of hired guns from one campaign to another and a news media intent on juicy revelations — have conspired to loosen the lips of politicians’ confidants and to spread the whispers fast and far.		
The resulting chatter can be more sudsy than substantive, and has at times reduced the 2008 election — one of urgent issues, historic precedents and profound consequence — into a mean-spirited (and possibly sexist) farce with libidinous husbands, hysterical wives, pricey haircuts, pricier wardrobes and a torrent of tears. In these renditions, the principal players make a typical 
“Survivor”
cast look like paragons of dignity and altruism.		
“It’s disgusting,” said Doug Sosnik, a Democratic consultant who was political director in the Clinton White House. He conceded that there was no shortage of leaking then — it filled a 1994 book by Bob Woodward, “The Agenda,” and a 1999 memoir by George Stephanopoulos, “All Too Human” — but said that the situation had deteriorated since.		
Other political veterans concurred, noting that the present era’s crop of behind-the-scenes tales have a feel that is fundamentally different from what writers like Theodore White and Richard Ben Cramer produced in the past. Their narratives wove together first-person observations of history in the making and plentiful on-the-record interviews. The purportedly definitive accounts offered today lean on vaguely attributed sources, permitting aides to settle scores and put forward versions of events that flatter themselves.		
Mr. Halperin said in a recent telephone interview that protecting sources from explicit identification was in fact the best way to get the unvarnished truth, and was a necessary weapon against what he argued was greater confidentiality in political circles. “We were able to fight the trend,” he said, referring to himself and his co-author.		
And he and other journalists and political strategists pointed out that there’s a tradition of campaign insiders serving up new details and new candor after the fact, for the sake of history.		
The 2008 race may not actually be the best measure of political loyalty. The backstories of the leading candidates, the milestones in play, the amount of money being raised — all of this meant that emotions ran especially high and defeat had a particularly bitter taste.		
And the race suggested that loyalty is not yet extinct: President Obama seemed to command it. To this day there has been little if any venting of major grievances or divulging of big secrets, which may or may not exist.		
That of course may be a function of his success, and it raises the same chicken-egg question that the generally closed-mouth nature of President George W. Bush’s political operation did: Does the loyalty seal the victory, or the victory the loyalty? No one points fingers or runs for cover in the winner’s circle.		 1  2 Next Page »
