Live musicals on network television might be here to stay.Fox’s broadcast of “Grease: Live!” scored big ratings Sunday night, with 12.2 million people tuning in. That makes it the second-most-viewed in the recent run of live TV musicals, behind only NBC’s “The Sound of Music Live!,” which kicked off the trend in December 2013. (The others, “Peter Pan Live!” and “The Wiz Live!,” also ran on NBC.)“Grease: Live!” also got a strong 4.3 rating in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic vital to advertisers, better than  “The Wiz,” which was broadcast in December.The Fox production was energetic, and received mostly warm reviews.

Meanwhile, Fox will move even faster than that. In March, it will broadcast a production of “The Passion,” live from New Orleans. The musical will depict Jesus Christ’s final days, and may be as ambitious as “Grease.” It will include an enormous procession of hundreds of people carrying a cross from the Superdome to a stage near the Mississippi River, and will be hosted by Tyler Perry.This is also the second straight week that Fox has benefited from a strong Sunday night. Last week, it debuted a revival of “The X-Files” — which followed the N.F.C. Championship — and scored a high rating as well.
