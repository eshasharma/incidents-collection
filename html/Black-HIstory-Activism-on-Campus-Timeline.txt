Black History: Activism on Campus


By STEFAN M. BRADLEY FEB. 1, 2016



It appears that history does indeed rhyme, as one famous Missourian, Mark Twain, is said to have quipped. Students are active again; protests have been ubiquitous as simmering grievances have kindled a crisis. But boycotts by athletes, building occupations and resignation demands — all to force change for students of color — are not new acts. This academic year, Black Lives Matter has found a place on campuses like the University of Missouri, Yale, Princeton and the historically black Howard University in the same way that the civil rights and black power movements once did. This timeline is hardly exhaustive, but it provides some linear and ideological connections between the current campaigns and those of the past.
