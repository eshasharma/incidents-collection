New Air Security Checks From 14 Nations to U.S. Draw Criticism

WASHINGTON  The Obama administration’s decision to mandate extra scrutiny  including full-body pat downs  for people flying into the United States from 14 mostly Muslim countries provoked criticism from foreign officials and skepticism from some security experts that the measures would be effective.

Full-Body Scans to Be Used for Flights From Amsterdam to U.S. 

(December 31, 2009)














American counterterrorism officials said the increased   checks reflected mounting concern about the  threat posed by foreign-based extremists and dissatisfaction with security in certain airports overseas.“We are only as strong as our weakest point,” said Cindy Farkus, the head of global security programs at the Transportation Security Administration. “We are always trying to stay ahead of where the emerging threats might be.”Passengers arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on overseas flights late Monday described the security changes. Several women flying from Qatar reported being subjected to pat downs that included an uncomfortable probing of the area between their breasts. But most of the passengers interviewed said they did not object to the extra scrutiny. “They combed through everything, my belt, my vest, my cardigan,” said Kingsley Udeh, 32, of Nigeria. The revised rules, which apply to airlines that fly to the United States, were imposed by an agency that has long insisted that it avoided racial or ethnic profiling. But Transportation Security Administration officials said they had concluded in the past week that no technology now in place globally would let them comprehensively scan every passenger. Deploying such equipment worldwide would take years. Checking all passengers manually in the interim would be too disruptive, they said.In consultation with the State Department, they decided to narrow the list of countries where such checks would be mandatory to those whose populations would more likely include terrorism suspects. Other passengers will be randomly checked. Under the new rules, all citizens of Afghanistan, Algeria, Lebanon, Libya, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and Yemen must receive a pat down and an extra check of their carry-on bags before boarding a plane bound for the United States, officials said. Citizens of Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria  nations considered “state sponsors of terrorism”  face the same requirement.Leaders of the affected countries argued that the United States had essentially declared their entire population suspects and created a two-tier system for air travel.“It is unfair to discriminate against over 150 million people because of the behavior of one person,” Dora Akunyili, Nigeria’s information minister, said Monday, referring to a 23-year-old Nigerian man accused of hiding explosives in his underwear on a Dec. 25 flight to Detroit.The Algerian ambassador to the United States, Abdallah Baali, said he would file a protest once he was given formal notice of the change. “The United States has the right to protect the security of its citizens,” Mr. Baali said. “But this is discrimination against the citizens of Algeria, who do not pose any particular risk to the people of the United States.”Americans traveling overseas will also frequently be subjected to some additional security measures before boarding a plane to the United States, officials said. But if a passenger is not from one of these 14 countries or has not taken a flight that originated or passed through them, the added screening will not be mandatory. Transportation security officials on Monday defended the new measures. “T.S.A. does not profile,” said Kristin Lee, an agency spokeswoman. “As is always the case, T.S.A. security measures are based on threat, not ethnic or religious background.”Some counterterrorism experts question how effective the new measures will be. Rick Nelson, a retired Navy commander and former supervisor at the National Counterterrorism Center, said terrorists could turn to a technique perfected by drug couriers  hiding explosive materials in body cavities. Instead of mandating pat downs, he argued, the United States must improve its intelligence network to disrupt plots before would-be terrorists reach airport checkpoints.“We have to be careful not to play into the narrative that Al Qaeda has made up, where it is Islam versus the West,” he said. “We risk alienating the moderate populations that we need to be successful against Al Qaeda.”But current and former Homeland Security Department officials said that the pattern of attempted attacks  including Richard Reid, the so-called shoe bomber in 2001; the 2006 plot to sneak explosive liquids aboard United States-bound planes in London; and the Christmas Day plot  suggested that similar tactics would be tried again.A 2007 report by the Government Accountability Office said that half of the foreign airports inspected had at least one critical security weakness, including guards who allowed passengers to walk through a metal detector without additional scrutiny, even after the alarm went off.Ms. Farkus, who is in charge of an office created in part to respond to this report, said the agency now has 22 inspectors around the world to check to see if airports are meeting international standards.But diplomats and civil rights advocates said the agency had gone too far. “First look at behavior, not at faith or skin color,” said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “Then spend what it takes to obtain more bomb-sniffing dogs, to install more sophisticated bomb-detection equipment and to train security personnel in identifying the behavior of real terror suspects.”Flora Fair and Sarah Maslin Nir contributed reporting from New York.
