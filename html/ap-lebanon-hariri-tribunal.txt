THE HAGUE, Netherlands —  Appeals judges at a special U.N.-backed tribunal on the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri have overturned the conviction of the manager of a local TV station in Beirut who was found guilty last year of not removing from the station's website information about confidential witnesses in the long-running probe.The Special Tribunal for Lebanon on Tuesday also said that Al-Jadeed TV's deputy director, Karma Khayat, doesn't have to pay the 10,000-euro ($11,000) fine imposed on her following her conviction last year.The 2005 suicide bombing that killed Hariri and 22 others was one of the Middle East's most dramatic political assassinations. The court is trying in absentia five members of Hezbollah accused in the bombing.
