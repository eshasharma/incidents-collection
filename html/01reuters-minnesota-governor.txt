(Reuters) - Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton was hospitalized on Sunday after fainting during an event at a Minneapolis suburb, the governor's chief of staff, Jaime Tincher, said in a statement.Bob Hume, senior adviser for the governor said on Monday that Dayton, 69, was in "great spirits" and had most likely fainted due to dehydration.Dayton was speaking Sunday at a crowded event in Woodbury when he "began to feel increased pressure in his lower back," according to the statement Sunday from Tincher. He then lost consciousness and was transported to Regions Hospital in the city of St Paul.The governor remained in hospital overnight for observation as a precaution.Dayton underwent elective lower back surgery in December, similar to a procedure he had three years earlier that fused two vertebrae in his lower back, a spokesman said.Hume said the governor's office planned to release a statement once Dayton is discharged.(Reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit; Editing by Bernadette Baum)
