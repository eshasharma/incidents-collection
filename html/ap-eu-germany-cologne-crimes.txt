BERLIN —  Cologne authorities have released a series of pictures of men suspected of sexually harassing women on New Year's Eve in the western German city.Prosecutors said Tuesday the five pictures of varying quality are of suspects who sexually harassed or insulted their victims and attempted to rob them. They were taken by witnesses and victims.Authorities are asking for anyone recognizing the suspects to contact them with any information.The spate of thefts and assaults on women near Cologne's main station, blamed largely on foreigners, caused public uproar as Germany faces a huge influx of migrants. More than 1,000 criminal complaints were filed, more than 400 of those alleging sexual crimes.
