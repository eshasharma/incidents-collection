A former Goldman Sachs computer programmer pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges he stole code from the bank’s lucrative high-frequency trading platform before leaving for another company last year.The former programmer, Sergey Aleynikov,  is charged with theft of trade secrets, transportation of stolen property and unauthorized computer access. If convicted, Mr. Aleynikov faces up to 25 years in prison.Mr. Aleynikov, 40, is free on bail. Last week,  an indictment that formalized charges initially brought last July was unsealed.  According to the indictment, on his last day working for Goldman on June 5, 2009, prosecutors say that Mr. Aleynikov transferred Goldman computer code for its trading platform to an outside computer server. They said he encrypted the files and transferred them over the Internet without informing Goldman Sachs.The  prosecutors and the F.B.I. say that he sent code files to his personal e-mail account from a Goldman e-mail account, storing versions of the code files on home computers, a laptop and other storage devices.They said that, on July 2, he took the laptop and another storage device to a meeting in Chicago with his new employer, Teza Technologies, a high-frequency trading start-up.
