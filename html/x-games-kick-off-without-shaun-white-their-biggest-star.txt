The Winter X Games, ESPN’s extravaganza of extreme snow sports, kicked off on Thursday with its crowd-pleasing showcase of some of the world’s best aerial athletes.But a mystery has settled over the high-altitude stage in Aspen, Colo.Shaun White, whose style and dominance of snowboarding over a decade have made him the sport’s biggest star, is not in the lineup — and so far nobody is saying why. “He was not invited,” Danny Chi, an ESPN spokesman, said in an email. He declined to discuss it further.Efforts to reach White, 29, were unsuccessful.As recently as September, he appeared to want to compete. During an online chat with readers of The Seattle Times, White said, “So far the plan is to compete at the next Winter X Games, but I’m still waiting to lock in my season plans.”His absence leaves a void in the annual competition, which White has participated in every year since 2000 with the exception of 2014, when he was preparing for the Olympics. His résumé includes two Olympic gold medals and 23 medals in the X Games, including 15 golds.In 2015, Tim Reed, vice president of the X Games, said White was ESPN’s largest draw for the competition.“Everyone is aware, when it comes to cultural awareness, or social awareness, he kind of transcends,” Reed said at the time. “Those who don’t necessarily follow this stuff, they’re aware of Shaun. There’s more awareness and more desire to come watch what happens.”His performance at last year’s competition was disappointing, as he looked rusty while finishing fourth in the superpipe. He also finished fourth in the 2014 Winter Olympics.In his most recent competition, he won the Dew Tour superpipe in December.White — who would rather not be called by his nickname, the Flying Tomato — announced on Thursday that he had bought a minority share of Mammoth Resorts, which operates the resorts in Southern California where he first learned to ride a snowboard.“It’s amazing that I’m now an owner of the mountain where I grew up riding,” White said in a news release.
