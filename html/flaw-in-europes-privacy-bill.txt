To the Editor:Your excellent Dec. 21 editorial “Missteps in Europe’s Online Privacy Bill” does not mention a serious fault in the European legislation. There appears to be no “cutoff date,” so the right to be forgotten will outlast a person’s life. This will permit an individual to alter history, or produce incorrect or false history.There should be a statute of limitations defining a date when the right lapses, and the censored information is freely available. Even a false statement is historically important, as it may explain actions taken that would otherwise seem odd or inconsistent.And I agree that such privacy regulations should not be enforceable in other nations. I trust that our First Amendment would overrule any foreign regulations.PAUL SILVERSTONENew YorkThe writer is a member of the Public Records Access Monitoring Committee of the International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies.
