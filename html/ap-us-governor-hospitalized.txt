ST. PAUL, Minn. —  Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton could be released from the hospital Monday, a senior staffer said, a day after the 69-year-old governor fainted at a hot and crowded event.Dayton's office said Dayton had been feeling pressure in his lower back before he lost consciousness Sunday at the function for a state representative's volunteer campaign staff in the Twin Cities suburb of Woodbury. He underwent elective back surgery in early December.Deputy chief of staff Bob Hume said Dayton was still receiving fluids and undergoing tests Monday morning while working with staff from his hospital bed. Hume said all signs pointed toward dehydration as the cause for Dayton's collapse."He's very much looking forward to going home," Hume said, expressing hope that the governor would be released from the hospital Monday.Staff at the Regions Hospital in St. Paul at first deferred to the governor's office for an update on his condition and didn't immediately respond to messages later Monday.The state representative whose function Dayton was attending didn't respond to an email or a phone message seeking details about what happened Sunday evening.Dayton's staff said Sunday night that he was "resting comfortably and joking with family, doctors and staff."Questions about his health have dogged Dayton — the oldest person elected to the Minnesota governor's office — since he took office in 2011.After the most recent of three major surgeries, a voluntary procedure to fuse two vertebrae in his lower back, Dayton brushed aside any suggestion that recurring health problems would affect his work or force him out of office before completing his second term. Dayton had a similar procedure in 2011 and also underwent hip surgery in 2014 to repair a damaged tendon."For the next three years, if I'm living and breathing, I will be the governor of the state of Minnesota," he told reporters last month.The surgeries forced the Democratic governor out of the public eye for days and sometimes weeks. Since the December procedure, he's usually spotted walking gingerly, often with a cane, during public appearances.Dayton had been scheduled to meet with staff and a top Minnesota lawmaker on Monday. Hume said the governor likely wouldn't have any events after his release.
