LONDON —  Former world heavyweight champion Frank Bruno wants to make a return to competitive boxing at the age of 54.Bruno was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2003, an illness he says has left him feeling "suicidal." He has been involuntarily committed to psychiatric care on three occasions."I've got to get back into boxing, to get this out of my system, because I don't want to end up in (psychiatric) hospital," Bruno, who is back in training, told British broadcaster ITV on Monday.Bruno won the WBC heavyweight belt in 1995, beating Oliver McCall, and hasn't fought since losing to Mike Tyson the following year.The British Boxing Board of Control would need to grant Bruno a license to box."Mr. Bruno has not made an application for a British Boxing Board of Control boxer's licence," Robert Smith, general-secretary of the BBBC, said in a emailed letter to The Associated Press, "and should such an application be received it will be considered in the normal manner by the stewards of the board."
