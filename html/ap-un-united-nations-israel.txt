UNITED NATIONS —  U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called Israeli criticism of attacks on its settlement policy unsustainable in an opinion piece published Sunday by The New York Times, doubling down on comments that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said justified terrorism.In the piece entitled, "Don't Shoot the Messenger, Israel," Ban reiterated many of his comments to the U.N. Security Council last week, when he called Israeli settlement activity "an affront to the Palestinian people" and said "it is human nature to resist occupation."He also called for a freeze on settlement activity. Most of the international community views Israeli settlements in the West Bank as illegal or illegitimate."Criticism of the United Nations — or attacks against me — comes with the territory. But when heartfelt concerns about shortsighted or morally damaging policies emanate from so many sources, including Israel's closest friends, it cannot be sustainable to keep lashing out at every well-intentioned critic," Ban wrote.Ban wrote that he would always stand up for Israel's right to exist, but added that "the time has come for Israelis, Palestinians and the international community to read the writing on the wall: The status quo is untenable. Keeping another people under indefinite occupation undermines the security and the future of both Israelis and Palestinians."Ban's criticism was sparked by Israel's recent approval of 150 new homes in settlements on the West Bank. In the opinion piece, Ban also pointed out that Israel has declared 370 acres in the West Bank, "state land," which he said "typically leads to exclusive settler use."
