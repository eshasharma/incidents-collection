The Italian chicory called radicchio comes in many guises. The round-headed radicchio di Chioggia is the most commonly known here, but the others, like the elongated Treviso and the curly fingered Tardivo are increasingly available. They sport shades of red, from burgundy to crimson to oxblood. The chicory family is a large one, though, and other members come in other colors, such as the fetchingly speckled yellow-cast Castelfranco; pale green broad-leafed escarole; curly endive or pointy-leaved Belgian endives, which are ivory or pink. All feature a pleasantly bittersweet flavor and require a somewhat assertive vinaigrette. Use only one type of chicory if you wish, but a colorful mixture of many kinds is a sight to behold.

Preparation

Tear radicchio or Castelfranco leaves into rough 2-inch pieces (if you add other chicories, they are better sliced into 2-inch-wide ribbons) and put them in a salad bowl.
Make the dressing: Combine the garlic, anchovy, mustard, vinegar and lemon juice in a small bowl. Add 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and a generous amount of pepper. Whisk in the olive oil. Taste and adjust seasoning.
Make the salad: Sprinkle the chicory leaves with a pinch of salt and add 3 tablespoons dressing. Toss well, making sure all leaves are coated lightly. Taste a leaf and add more dressing as needed. Add croutons and grated cheese before serving.


              Tip
            


For a cooked version of this salad, grill or broil Belgian endives split lengthwise and radicchio wedges. Arrange on a plate and spoon dressing over them. Serve warm or at room temperature. The dressing can be made several hours in advance and may be refrigerated up to 2 days.
