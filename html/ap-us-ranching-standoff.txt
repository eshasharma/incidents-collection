PORTLAND, Ore. —  Lawyers for the leader of the armed standoff at an Oregon wildlife refuge have appealed a judge's decision to keep him in jail pending trial.U.S. Magistrate Judge Stacie Beckerman said Ammon Bundy presents a danger to the community and the Idaho resident might fail to return for future court proceedings.Bundy's lawyers said in documents filed Sunday that their client should be released with a GPS monitoring device and orders he not leave Idaho except for court appearances.U.S. District Court Judge Michael W. Mosman is expected to hear the matter Tuesday, when he also considers the government's challenge of the release of another member of the armed group, Joseph O'Shaughnessy.Bundy and O'Shaughnessy are among 11 people arrested. Only one — Shawna Cox — has left jail.
