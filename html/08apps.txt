On Tuesday, New York City rolled out the next phase of its NYC BigApps competition, an initiative that will supply local programmers and developers with a stockpile of raw municipal data sets to build applications for the Web and mobile phones.

But in what appears to have been an accidental data breach, the city provided, as part of one data set, private information from representatives of women’s groups. A data file containing information on 1,100 such groups that had registered with the city’s Commission on Women’s Issues included fields for each participant’s “secret question” and answer. (Participants had been asked for the question and answer to log in to the Women’s Resource Network, a Web site organized by the commission.) In a statement on Wednesday, the city’s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications acknowledged the lapse and said it had taken steps to rectify the situation. Nicholas T. Sbordone, a spokesman for the department, said in a statement: “With an unprecedented amount of open city data comes an added level of responsibility to safeguard personal information, a charge the city  and NYC BigApps administrators  takes most seriously. We immediately addressed the issues with the two columns of data out of more than 170 data sets across 30 city agencies and commissions, and reviewed all other information to ensure no similar instances.”Officials added that the city had immediately removed the data set from its site after learning about the breach and that there was no indication that anyone had tried to use the private information to log in to the Women’s Resource Network.Some people whose data was provided as part of the breach expressed dismay when contacted about the matter. “That’s not too good,” said Sheryl H. Fields, who learned that the maiden name of her deceased mother, Valerie Holland, was part of the data set released by the city. “When you give a secret question, you don’t expect it to get published.” Ms. Fields had provided the information in her former position as president of the Brooklyn chapter of the International Association of Administrative Professionals. “I’m not the contact person for them anymore,” she added.Although Ms. Fields’s mother died three years ago, Ms. Fields said, “It’s private information.”Another person whose data was released was Leah Shamalov, director of communications and special events for the Russian American Foundation. Ms. Shamalov’s secret data  was the name of her dog, Smokey. “I’m not really that concerned,” Ms. Shamalov said. “It wasn’t something like a top-secret Web site. If you came back and told me my credit card company had released my information, I would be more concerned.”Ms. Shamalov added: “Smokey died years ago. He was the only pet my family ever had.” Angeline Martyn, the communications director for Americans for Unfpa, a group that supports women’s rights and the United Nations Population Fund, learned that her secret question  her boss’s least-favorite color  was no longer so secret. “I came up with that one because I knew everyone in the office would know the answer,” Ms. Martyn said, adding, “I’m glad the city has caught the error.”
