The numbers will rise when time-shifted viewing is taken into account; the 2014 season premiere reached 15.5 million viewers after a month."These six seasons of 'Downton Abbey' have truly been a fantastic ride for all of us in the public television family," said Paula Kerger, PBS president and CEO.The household help on "Downton Abbey" proved no match for Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio as television stars.
