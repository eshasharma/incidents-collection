SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea flouted United Nations resolutions on Thursday by launching two ballistic missiles toward the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, the South Korean military said in a statement.The two projectiles, believed to be Scud-C missiles, took off from a site south of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, and flew across the peninsula before crashing into the sea off the North’s east coast, the statement said. They flew about 310 miles.Under a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions, North Korea is banned from developing or testing ballistic missiles. The ban was imposed after the North’s tests of nuclear weapons and long-range rockets in recent years raised fears that the country was developing a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea also launched two Scud missiles in March last year.The North often launches missiles when the United States and South Korea conduct their joint annual military drills. This year’s drills began this week.Also on Thursday, North Korea threatened to liquidate all South Korean assets in the country, including 123 factories in an industrial park that was jointly run by the Koreas until the South shut it down it last month. Pyongyang had already said it would freeze South Korean assets at the park, in the North Korean town of Kaesong.
