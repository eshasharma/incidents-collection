To the Editor:Re “Ruling Drones, Before They Rule Us” (editorial, Jan. 10):You are right to endorse the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, an important policy framework that could provide meaningful privacy protections for consumers and reduce the growing risk of a trade dispute between the United States and Europe, where stronger privacy safeguards are already in place. Congress should act quickly on a legislative proposal.But that will not address the unique privacy problems associated with drone surveillance. Freedom of Information Act cases pursued by the Electronic Privacy Information Center make clear that unmanned aerial vehicles have extraordinary surveillance capabilities that will only increase as technology evolves.In EPIC v. F.A.A., we sued the agency for its failure to develop a privacy rule as mandated by Congress and as demanded by more than 100 organizations and experts. A federal appeals court will hear arguments in that case next month.MARC ROTENBERGWashingtonThe writer is president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the author of “Privacy in the Modern Age: The Search for Solutions.”
