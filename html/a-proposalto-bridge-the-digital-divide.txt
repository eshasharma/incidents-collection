The details of how to help close the digital divide are coming into focus.At least that’s the message from the Federal Communications Commission, which has put together a final proposal to overhaul its Lifeline fund, a program to help low-income households with technology needs. The F.C.C. is announcing on Tuesday that it is poised to approve a broadband subsidy of $9.25 a month for those who qualify, to defray the costs of getting high-speed Internet, writes Cecilia Kang.Last month, Ms. Kang published a story showing the toll that a lack of high-speed Internet is taking on teens and young children. In her reporting, Ms. Kang found families in an area in South Texas who lacked the funds for Internet access and whose children had to take three-hour rides on buses with Wi-Fi or crouch on sidewalks outside schools with Wi-Fi hot spots in order to complete their homework.

“This is what I call the homework gap, and it is the cruelest part of the digital divide,” Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic member of the commission who has pushed to overhaul the Lifeline program, said at the time.Given the F.C.C.’s final proposal, the story is worth reading again to understand how deep the digital divide can be.
