Google said Friday that it was strengthening its  privacy controls after its mapping service mistakenly gathered e-mail messages and passwords from unsecured wireless networks.The company is also improving training for workers, including engineers, in areas like  product management and legal affairs, and strengthening compliance procedures,  Google said in a blog post. In addition,  Alma Whitten, Google’s engineering leader on privacy, was named director of policy for engineering and product management.Google has faced investigations by  authorities in the United States  and many other countries for the way it gathered data with its Street View service. The company first disclosed the security breach in May.“These changes will significantly improve our internal practices (though no system can of course entirely eliminate human error), and we look forward to seeing the innovative new security and privacy features that Alma and her team develop,” Alan Eustace,  senior vice president, engineering and research, said.  “That said, we’ll be constantly on the lookout for additional improvements to our procedures as Google grows, and as we branch out into new fields of computer science.”
