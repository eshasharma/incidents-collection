Johnny Manziel’s rocky start to his NFL career has taken a new twist with the news that the Cleveland Browns quarterback has entered rehab.
 “Brad Beckworth, a friend and advisor to Manziel and his family, has confirmed that Johnny entered treatment on Wednesday,’’ a statement from Manziel’s publicist, Denise Michaels read. The statement was first released to Northeast Ohio Media Group. “Johnny knows there are areas in which he needs to improve in order to be a better family member, friend and team-mate and he thought the off-season was the right time to take this step. On behalf of Johnny and his family, we’re asking for privacy until he rejoins the team in Cleveland.”
 Manziel has come under criticism for his lifestyle, with many people believing his partying detracted from his playing abilities. The Browns fined Manziel after he did not show up for medical treatment towards the end of the season. It was later revealed that Manziel had thrown a party the night before. One team source told ESPN that Manziel had been “drunk off his ass”.
“I brought this on myself,” Manziel said after the Browns’ final game of the season. “I brought these cameras and all these people that are in this locker room right now and I don’t think it’s fair to myself, I don’t think it’s fair to anybody in this locker room the distractions I’ve brought at points in time.”
 The Browns said on Monday that they supported Manziel’s decision to enter rehab. “we fully support Johnny’s initiative in this decision, and will fully support him through this process,” said the Browns’ general manager, Ray Farmer. “Our players’ health and well-being will always be of the utmost importance to the Cleveland Browns. 
Manziel’s failed to impress in his first NFL season. After a brilliant college career, he was drafted in the first round by the Browns. However, he saw limited playing time and threw two interceptions and no touchdowns, completing just 51.4% of his passes.
