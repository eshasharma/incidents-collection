SAN DIEGO —  Brandt Snedeker won the praise of his peers for a closing round at Torrey Pines that left them in awe.Now he has a trophy to show for it.Snedeker won the Farmers Insurance Open on Monday when the conditions turned out to be just as tough as when he shot his 69 on Sunday, a score that was roughly nine shots better than the field average.Jimmy Walker had a one-shot lead on Snedeker and K. J. Choi when the final round resumed after strong winds had toppled about a dozen trees on the South Course. With a powerful wind from the opposite direction, Walker and Choi tried to hang on with pars and could not.“The way the wind blew and made those last five holes play so tough on those guys, I feel bad for them,” Snedeker said. “They got the raw end of the stick this morning. But that’s just the way golf goes, and luckily enough, I played good enough yesterday to get the job done. So it’s a special feeling, to say the least.”Snedeker won at six-under-par 282, the highest winning score at Torrey Pines since Fuzzy Zoeller’s 282 in 1979. The average score was 77.9, the highest fourth-round average at a regular PGA Tour event since the tour began keeping such statistics in 1983.Snedeker won for the second time at Torrey Pines. He played the final 17 holes without a bogey in winds of more than 40 miles per hour and occasional rain that forced suspension of play three times before the South Course was evacuated.Of the 23 players who finished on Sunday, there were 11 rounds in the 80s.
