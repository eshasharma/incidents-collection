The Tâke Personal Pocket Safe from Blackbox Innovations is like a safety deposit box to hold your critical digital information, including credit card and bank account numbers and all your passwords.The “safe” is   a U.S.B. drive with a numeric keypad and  encryption. After you enter your four-digit code, you have 30 seconds to insert the device into a computer before it locks. It also locks if it sits idle in the computer for more than three minutes.All the necessary software is on the drive, and it can be used on any PC without leaving a trace.  The software has forms that can be filled out with important phone numbers, addresses, account data and so forth. The drive is available for $49 at www.takeanyware.com.If you forget your code and haven’t registered it on the company’s secure Web site, there is no way for you to retrieve the data. The company also protects the hardware from being hacked. If you try to remove the flash memory chip, it will stop working — with more of a whimper than a Mission Impossible-style bang.  STEPHEN C. MILLER
