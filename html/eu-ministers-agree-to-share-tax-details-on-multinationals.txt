BRUSSELS — European Union finance ministers agreed on Tuesday to new rules under which their countries will exchange information on the tax affairs of multinationals, a move aimed at ensuring that big companies pay their fair share into government budgets.The rules, which should take effect this year, are a response to growing concerns that corporate tax avoidance costs the European Union 70 billion euros, or $77 billion a year, according to a European Parliament estimate.“Today, we reached a political agreement on cooperation between tax administrations, country-by-country reporting,” said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and the chair of the European Union ministers’ meeting in Brussels. “This is part of our work on the anti-tax avoidance package.”The new rules will oblige large companies to disclose data on revenues, profits and taxes to the administrations of all European Union countries where they operate. That data will then be exchanged among the 28 member states.The European Union deal goes beyond international guidelines approved by the Group of 20 and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Those guidelines do not force subsidiaries of foreign countries to disclose the tax data of their parent group, whereas the European Union rules will affect foreign multinationals that have subsidiaries in the bloc, officials said.Because of concerns expressed by Germany and some other European Union countries that the measures could scare away foreign investors, the new rules will be mandatory for foreign companies beginning next year.The rules are expected to be formally adopted by June, Mr. Dijsselbloem said. The unanimous approval of all the member states is required.Despite misgivings from some governments, the European Union tax commissioner Pierre Moscovici is considering proposing bolder provisions in the coming weeks to make company tax data available to the public, not just to state administrations.
