CURRENTS: SECURITY
CURRENTS: SECURITY; A Guardhouse to Make Deep Thinkers Think Twice


By EVE M. KAHN


Published: August 1, 2002









                    A pentagonal guardhouse with a canopy on tilted stilts, far right, has been added to the geometry of Rockefeller University, which also has a hemispherical auditorium and a parabolic atrium. Designed by Henry Smith-Miller and Laurie Hawkinson, right, the metal guardhouse hugs the filigree fencing at York Avenue and 66th Street. When completed, it will replace a wooden hut that is hard for visitors to find, said Cathy Yarbrough, a university spokeswoman. The structure, she said, ''suits the gestalt of this place -- it's part of the culture here to have surroundings that encourage people to think.'' The design was based on a 1930's fantasy by Iacov Chernikov, a Russian constructivist. Mr. Smith-Miller called the house a ''wonderful, outrageous, spectacular, energetic event,'' while conceding that it may be New York's smallest building.   EVE M. KAHN
