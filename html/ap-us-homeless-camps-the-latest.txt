DENVER —  The Latest on Denver's plans to clear out homeless camps (all times local):12:30 p.m.People who have set up camp near Denver's homeless shelters are packing up their belongings after the city warned that it would start removing items left on sidewalks there.The city said it could start enforcing the order as soon as Tuesday. But so far it hasn't begun confiscating any items in the neighborhood at the edge of downtown near Coors Field.Some people are moving their things to storage units, and others are just moving their camp farther away from the shelters.Only a handful of camps remain. Recently, the sidewalks were lined with people, shopping carts and other possessions.____8:45 a.m.Denver plans to start clearing out homeless camps that have developed around shelters as early as Tuesday.It's a problem confronting fast-growing cities across the country as affordable housing becomes scarcer.Denver says the camps scattered on sidewalks near Coors Field pose a health hazard. Spokeswoman Julie Smith says the city has tried to get people into shelters for the last six months.She says people won't be forced out, but their belongings will be put in storage.Some homeless people and advocates say many of those camped out there don't have anywhere else to live in a time of skyrocketing rents and they shouldn't be forced to live in crowded shelters.Last week in San Francisco, crews cleared out a homeless camp that officials had declared a health hazard.
