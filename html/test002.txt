Photographers – don’t pap our wild animals, they need some privacy too









Deer in a London park are failing to mate because of intrusive snappers. With wildlife already under threat, photographers need to focus on acting ethically

Every year the Natural History Museum puts on an exhibition of the most wonderful wildlife photographs. Every year I enter a fantasy universe in which I retreat to a hide with thousands of pounds’ worth of camera equipment to wait for the perfect fraction of a second that will win me such accolades. But then reality returns and I go back to photographing my son’s choir. But budding wildlife photographers have had their moment in the spotlight this week because of the impact they are having on the red and fallow deer in Richmond Park.
Right now the deer are coming to the end of the rut – the breeding season – which sees males display and fight in a most photogenic manner. And one has to wonder whether a swarm of 60 photographers surrounding a male as he tries to mate just might be an inhibitor to successful reproduction. It would certainly affect my capacity to perform.
Perhaps it is the Spring/Autumnwatch effect that is to blame – the idea that we can all get out into the “wild” and capture an extraordinary image. Perhaps it is the affordability and ubiquity of photography? Whatever the cause, it is clear that there needs to be some way for these keen amateurs to fulfil their photographic needs without too much upset to their targets.
This is an issue that extends well beyond deer reproduction. The sense of entitlement that can erupt when people are in possession of a camera is alarming. I can only imagine the distress our celebrity-obsessed culture’s demand for photographs heaps upon the well-known. And it happens in the natural world too – the charismatic megafauna can’t fornicate without intrusion.

Why do we want to take these photographs? Whether of the famous or wildlife, we want a record of our adventures, sure. But we should consider the impact the obsessive collection of images is having. At least celebrities besieged by cameras have recourse to lawyers and some potential protection, but at the moment wildlife is pretty much on its own. And it does matter. So much wildlife is already under a barrage of insults – through loss of habitat, food and dosing with industrial chemicals – that any extra pressure from our selfish intrusion could prove a tipping point.
The wonderfully talented wildlife photographer Craig Jones has inadvertently become a leading figure in the call for ethical wildlife photography. “True wildlife photography must be tied in with deep respect, it should be about capturing what is there, it is not about creating a work of fiction,” he told me. “And the quality of your image should include the quality of the life of the animal you are pursuing – so if you are blinding a tern with a flash gun, pinning out prey to lure in predators, or aggravating a tiger to gain a reaction, then your work and your integrity is compromised.”

Perhaps there needs to be a new definition for these people who invade an animal’s space with their camera phones. Wildlife photographers are people rich in fieldcraft, integrity and concern for the welfare and conservation of the animals they capture. Animal-paps are those who try to capture images without regard for the consequences.
The reason I love wildlife photography is for the stories it can tell about the animals I doubt I will ever meet. I do not want to find that these are works of fiction. And I do not want to find that the wildlife I love was harmed in the process. It can be done – Craig Jones and other true wildlife photographers have proved that.
