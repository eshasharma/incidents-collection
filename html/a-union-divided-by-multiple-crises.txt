BRUSSELS —  The European Union needs an ambitious grand bargain at its next summit meeting to rescue itself from an accumulation of crises that threaten to blow apart its model of integration.







Like children at a birthday party, each leader has to get a going-home present. And as with many children’s parties, there may be a tantrum along the way.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is at risk at home from a backlash against a mass influx of Syrian refugees. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain is trying to win a referendum on staying in the European Union and cannot help her because of public hostility to immigration. Nor can President François Hollande of France, who is struggling for re-election in a country transfixed by the threat from Islamist militants.Berlin, the Union’s pivotal power, sees controlling migration as the central priority as it tries to cope with one million asylum seekers who have arrived in the last year.

Ideally, the leaders need to forge a deal on Feb. 18 and 19 that encompasses effective action to strengthen Europe’s external borders and share the refugee burden, and a mutually acceptable solution to Britain’s demands to change its membership terms.A comprehensive package would also need to address Italy’s political and economic frustrations with the Union, Greece’s quest for substantial debt relief and Poland’s wish to see NATO strengthen its military presence in Eastern Europe to deter Russia.“These deals are only possible when countries are in a state of symmetrical despair,” said Laszlo Andor, a professor at the Université Libre de Bruxelles and a former European Commission member from Hungary.A package deal might yield a more integrated “core Europe,” adding a European Union border police and coast guard and a common asylum policy, and a looser union for countries like Britain that opt to stay outside the 19-nation common-currency eurozone.

Editorial: Europe Must Do Better on RefugeesJAN. 8, 2016







A deal with London seems within reach, one that would formally exempt Britain from the European goal of “ever closer union,” shield its financial sector from being regulated abusively by the eurozone, and let it withhold some benefits from new migrant workers if its social welfare system were under strain.The Union would cease to be a “two-speed Europe,” with all 28 members converging at different paces toward the same goal, and become a permanent two-tier or multitier construction, possibly with an outer circle of associates such as Turkey and Ukraine.While European leaders’ despair may not be symmetrical, the refugee crisis is concentrating minds on a threat that could break the Union, fan populism and alienate British voters.Donald Tusk, the European Council president, has warned that the Union has only six to eight weeks left to save the Schengen zone of passport-free travel. That raises the urgency of a deal with Greece and Italy, the main arrival points for migrants from Turkey and North Africa.Horse-trading to suit multiple national interests is a classic technique for advancing European integration and could break logjams in what Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, calls a “polycrisis.”

Rome is blocking a Union aid package for Turkey to help curb the influx of migrants into Europe; Athens is accused of failing to guard its borders or to register and retain asylum seekers on its soil; and Warsaw is under scrutiny in Brussels over laws shackling the judiciary and media. Each of those countries has hinted that it is willing to help others if its own interests are taken into account.Ms. Merkel is keen to help Mr. Cameron win his planned referendum on whether Britain should stay in the Union, but she is fighting for her own political skin in the refugee crisis.Berlin feels it has received little solidarity from its Union partners, while elsewhere there is a sense that reluctance to share the refugee burden is partly payback for perceived German bullying during the eurozone crisis.Germany and its allies are more inclined to use sticks than carrots with Greece. The European Commission last week gave Athens three months to fix “serious deficiencies” in its management of the bloc’s external frontiers or face suspension from the Schengen area. That deadline expires just as Greek debt talks are due to start.Domestic headwinds may make it harder for Ms. Merkel to use her dwindling political capital to offer concessions to Greece on rescheduling its debt to eurozone countries.Many in Berlin and Brussels doubt that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece can tighten border controls or keep tens of thousands of migrants penned up in his country until they can be relocated to reluctant Union states.Yet the chancellor has voiced understanding of Greece’s plight as a frontline state and says she wants a “European solution” to the refugee crisis. No one wants another “Grexit” crisis this year on top of the Union’s other woes.If Greek compliance is uncertain, Turkey’s cooperation in preventing migrants leaving its shores for Europe in return for 3 billion euros, or $3.25 billion, in aid is subject to deep skepticism.The Italians want more Union cash to cope with migrants landing on their shores and more fiscal leeway from Europe’s budget supervisors to stimulate their sluggish economy.Poland is the biggest supplier of migrant labor to Britain. Its foreign minister has hinted that it could acquiesce in London’s needs to curb in-work benefits for new arrivals if Mr. Cameron sends troops to provide a long-term NATO presence on its soil.The makings of trade-offs are easy to see, but in the fraught state of relations among Union leaders, it is a tall order.Paul Taylor is a Reuters correspondent.
