WASHINGTON —  The commander of military operations against the Islamic State group says there is a "good potential" he will need more U.S. and coalition forces to ramp up the fight as it extends across Iraq and Syria.Army Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland is telling Pentagon reporters that he is working on ways to increase pressure on the Islamic State militants, and some options may require more troops on the ground to assist local Iraqi or Syrian forces. He would not detail whether those would be trainers or combat troops.He says that while Iraqi leaders didn't accept the offer of U.S. Apache helicopters during the ultimately successful fight for Ramadi, they may decide to use the aircraft in a later battle.
