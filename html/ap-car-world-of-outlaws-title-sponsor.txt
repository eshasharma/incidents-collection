HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill. —  The World of Outlaws received a major boost Monday when Sears and Craftsman announced a three-year deal to become title sponsor of the dirt track racing series.The agreement begins immediately and renames the two premier series in the sport to the "World of Outlaws Craftsman Sprint Car Series" and "World of Outlaws Craftsman Late Model Series." It marks the first time the two top series in grassroots motorsports have shared a title sponsor."Our Craftsman Club members are passionate about building, improving and even racing their own cars," said Tom Park, president of Kenmore, Craftsman and DieHard brands at Sears Holdings. "These individuals exemplify what it means to be a craftsman and we are honored to be part of their lives as the title sponsor of the World of Outlaws."The relationship with Craftsman is unique to World of Outlaws because of its scope: The brand will reach sprint car and late model fans at nearly 140 events across the United States and Canada.Founded in 1978, the World of Outlaws enters 2016 with one of the busiest schedules ever. The series will travel coast-to-coast to more than 90 events, and the late model series competes nearly 50 times at 30 different venues.World of Outlaws CEO Brian Carter said the agreement is a "phenomenal opportunity."
