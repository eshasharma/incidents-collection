INDIANAPOLIS —  The NCAA says its board of governors has voted to extend the contract of President Mark Emmert three years, through October 2020.In a statement released by the NCAA on Monday, Kansas State President and board chairman Kirk Schulz says Emmert is "integral in leading the association forward as we navigate the complex and challenging way ahead, while better supporting student-athletes."The board approved an extension during the NCAA convention last month in San Antonio. The vote included an option to add another year to the deal.Emmert has led the NCAA since 2010. He was previously the president of the University of Washington. His tenure has been marked by dramatic changes in the way the NCAA does business and near constant pressure from lawsuits against the association.
