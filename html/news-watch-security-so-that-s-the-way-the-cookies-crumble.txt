NEWS WATCH: SECURITY
NEWS WATCH: SECURITY; So, That's the Way The Cookies Crumble


By J.D. Biersdorfer


Published: October 2, 2003









                    In these days of worms, Trojan horse attachments and other security threats delivered through the Internet, the personal computer can seem like a medieval castle under siege. Fireball CyberProtection Suite from Red Cannon Security offers several weapons for the defense arsenal so you will not have to dig a moat around your desk.        

                    The suite includes a firewall program with security controls for both novices and advanced users as well as a set of privacy-protection features that can monitor incoming and outgoing e-mail, smash snoopy browser cookies, block Javascript code and pop-up ads, and filter content from Web sites. Parental control functions within the software can be used to monitor and restrict a child's use of the Internet. Telecommuters and others connecting to corporate systems from home or a hotel can use the virtual private network program that comes in the software suite to keep their connections confidential.        

                    Fireball CyberProtection works with Windows 98 and later and sells for $49.95 in stores or online at www.redcannon.com, where a free trial version is also available for downloading. Among the special features is a System Scan that keeps an eye out for security problems in Internet Explorer and Windows and will download software patches and updates from Microsoft as soon as needed, subtracting a chore from the weekly To Do list.   J.D. Biersdorfer
