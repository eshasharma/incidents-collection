Numbers reported to the Federal Election Commission and the Internal Revenue Service are shown in black. Figures that were announced to the news media but not officially filed are shown in gray.



Archived coverage from Oct. 15, 2015
On Oct. 15, candidates filed reports with the Federal Election Commission on their finances through Sept. 30. The filings paint only a partial picture, however, because most outside groups supporting the candidates, like “super PACs,” will not submit their latest figures until Jan. 31.



 Hillary Rodham Clinton raised $29.9 million for her campaign in the third quarter, just ahead of Bernie Sanders, who raised $26.2 million.

Half of the reported money in the campaign so far has come from donations to groups outside the campaigns, like “super PACs,” that are not subject to limits.
The 2016 campaign is significantly outpacing recent election cycles in contributions at this point, and the source of the money has shifted away from candidates’ committees, which can accept only $2,700 per election from individuals.

Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has $33 million in cash remaining, followed by Mr. Sanders. A lack of campaign cash contributed to the withdrawals of Rick Perry and Scott Walker, who relied heavily on super PAC support.

More than 88 percent of contributions to Mr. Sanders through Sept. 30 came from donations of $200 or less. Donald Trump received 72 percent from small donations; unlike last spring, he is no longer self-financing his campaign.
Contributions make up a portion of a candidate’s total amount raised; they don’t include loans or transfers from that candidate’s previous committees.

Many of the lowest fund-raisers had the highest “burn rates” of spending. Mrs. Clinton and Jeb Bush had the highest burn rates of remaining candidates who raised at least $5 million in the third quarter.
Candidate burn rates are calculated by dividing the amount they spent last quarter by the amount they raised.
