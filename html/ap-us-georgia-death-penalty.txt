ATLANTA —  The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles plans to consider a clemency request from the state's oldest death row inmate.The board plans to hold a hearing on the request from Brandon Astor Jones on Monday. The 72-year-old is scheduled for execution at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the state prison in Jackson.The parole board is the only entity in Georgia with the authority to commute a death sentence.Jones was convicted in the 1979 killing of Cobb County convenience store manager Roger Tackett.A federal judge granted Jones a new sentencing hearing because jurors had improperly been allowed to bring a Bible into the deliberation room. He was resentenced to death in 1997.Another man convicted in the killing, Van Roosevelt Solomon, was executed in 1985.
