Donald Trump’s Southern California supporters want to put him in the fast lane for the GOP nomination — even if it means hacking into freeway signs.The  electronic display on Interstate 15 in Corona was reprogrammed to read: 'Inland Empire supports Donald Trump. Merry Xmas. Vote Donald Trump.'Nikki Worden was on her way back from the movies when she and her husband saw the sign backing the Republican candidate.The pair exited the freeway, turned around and passed the message again while recording it on video, according to KABC-TV Channel 7.






  
 Donald Trump addresses supporters at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan days before someone hacked and reprogrammed a California sign encouraging people to vote for himThe post has received more than 500,000 views since Worden published it on Facebook on Friday night. The sign was fixed on Saturday.The Riverside County Transportation Commission told KABC-TV Channel 7 that the sign was a prank.'Someone accessed the message sign. Hacked into the message and changed it for their own purposes,' said Anne Mayer with the commission.
