PARIS — Around the time Rupert Murdoch married wife No. 4, the former model Jerry Hall, Wendi Deng (wife No. 3) was a near-ubiquitous presence at Paris Fashion Week.On Saturday, Ms. Deng was in the front row at Nina Ricci, seated next to Anna Wintour, then again on Sunday at Céline and Givenchy (where Ms. Wintour reminded Ms. Deng and Bradley Cooper, another seat mate, that they had met each other at the Met Gala in New York), Monday at Saint Laurent and Giambattista Valli, and Tuesday morning at Chanel.

“I don’t usually come to Paris for fashion week, but I decided to this weekend,” Ms. Deng said at the Chanel show, where the designer Karl Lagerfeld had turned the Grand Palais into a showroom the size of nearly four football fields, each person assigned a front-row seat in a maze that created something of an obstacle course for the models.

“It’s been such fun, I can’t tell you,” she said. “The standout shows for me have been Givenchy and also Saint Laurent last night, which was simply incredible.”“Hedi gave us beautiful party dresses in a simply gorgeous setting,” she said, referring to Hedi Slimane of Saint Laurent.Ms. Deng pronounced herself a major fan of Chanel — a statement supported by the fact that she was dressed in the label from head to toe — and added that she had dinner with Mr. Lagerfeld while in town. “He really is just the most energetic and creative man and so interesting to talk to,” she said before Cindi Leive, the editor of Glamour, walked over for a few words.Several aisles over, hordes of paparazzi seemed on the verge of punches in the hopes of getting in a better position to photograph Pharrell Williams, who was enthusiastically greeting Jonathan Newhouse, chief executive of Condé Nast International, while Willow Smith, Stella Tennant, Caroline de Maigret and Ines de la Fressange sat close by. Mr. Williams had newly blond hair, which appeared to match his sunny disposition, even when the scrum continued post-show.“It was just amazing; it was like being hit by a barrage of creativity and not at all how I expected,” the singer said as he tried to shuffle backstage. “I’ve worked with Karl on projects before, so I know he’s the real deal.“I’ve seen the ideas when they are sketched out onto the page and how rapidly those visions come to fruition,” he continued. “It’s like magic. He’s the definition of creative with elegance.”
