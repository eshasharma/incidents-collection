DENVER —  Furniture Row Racing has withdrawn its appeal of a penalty for illegal roof flaps. Crew chief Cole Pearn will serve his one-race suspension this weekend at Phoenix International Raceway.Pearn was suspended last week by NASCAR because an unapproved part was found on Martin Truex Jr.'s during prerace inspection at Atlanta. The team appealed, but decided Tuesday to drop the case after team president Joe Garone received clarification of the penalty from NASCAR.Garone was satisfied with the explanation he received.Todd Berrier will be Truex's crew chief at Phoenix.Berrier is director of fabrication at Joe Gibbs Racing but was crew chief for Furniture Row for nearly two seasons. Pearn was the engineer under Berrier during that time.
