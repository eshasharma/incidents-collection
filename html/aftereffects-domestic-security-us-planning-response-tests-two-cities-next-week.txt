AFTEREFFECTS: DOMESTIC SECURITY
AFTEREFFECTS: DOMESTIC SECURITY; U.S. Planning Response Tests In Two Cities Next Week


By PHILIP SHENON


Published: May 6, 2003









WASHINGTON, May 5— 
                    The cities of Chicago and Seattle will be the focus of a $16 million exercise next week to test how well the federal government would deal with simultaneous attacks by terrorists using biological and radiological weapons, the Bush administration said today.        

                    The exercise, said to be the largest domestic security drill ever carried out by the federal government, will be played out over five days starting on Monday and involve dozens of federal, state and local emergency-response agencies.        

                    In Chicago, emergency-response teams will be asked to pretend that they are dealing with the release of pneumonic plague, a deadly biological agent that is highly contagious. In Seattle, local agencies will be asked to respond to a scenario in which more than 100 people are injured in the explosion of a ''dirty bomb,'' a weapon created when radiological material is wrapped around common explosives.        

                    In Washington, several senior Bush administration officials, led by Tom Ridge, the secretary of homeland security, will try to organize the federal response to the attacks and to track the terrorists. Other senior administration, including President Bush and his chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., will be portrayed by stand-ins.        

                    ''While the exercise scenario and the extent of damage are based on a hypothetical situation, they do reflect plausible threats to the United States,'' Mr. Ridge said at a briefing today, adding that ''no actual explosives or other harmful substances will be used.''        

                    The exercise is the second Congressionally mandated simulation of its type. The first was carried out in 2000, focused on imaginary terrorist attacks in Colorado and New Hampshire. That drill exposed huge communications and coordination problems among federal and local emergency-response teams.        

                    Mr. Ridge said today that he was not worried that the exercise would cause panic in Chicago and Seattle, even though in both cities, emergency-response teams will be asked to rush to the street to tend to the ''injuries'' of volunteer actors who will pretend to have been injured by the attacks.        

                    ''We'll be working in very close coordination with state and locals to remind people on a daily basis up to and through the exercise that this is a test, this is an exercise,'' he said.        

                    Officials from the Homeland Security Department said Chicago and Seattle were chosen because they were large metropolitan areas that were geographically dispersed, and because both Illinois and Washington had volunteered for the drill.

Next to Mr. Ridge was Mayor Greg Nickles of Seattle. (Doug Mills/The New York Times)
