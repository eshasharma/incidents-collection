BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo —  The Republic of Congo’s government has ordered the country’s two largest telecommunications providers to block all communications during a presidential election on Sunday for security reasons, a government official said Saturday.The decision will cause inconvenience and possible alarm in a country where many rely on cellphone communication, and a prominent government critic said it would impede the work of election monitors.President Denis Sassou Nguesso is expected to extend his long rule in a contest against eight opponents, including a retired general, Jean-Marie Mokoko, who is seen as the strongest challenger.Mr. Mokoko was summoned to the state security headquarters on Saturday as part of a continuing security investigation, said Charles Zacharie Bowao, the president of the opposition coalition to which Mr. Mokoko belongs.The Interior Ministry sent a letter to the telecommunications companies MTN Congo and Airtel Congo to tell them “to cut off communication on March 20 and 21 for reasons of security and public tranquillity.”
