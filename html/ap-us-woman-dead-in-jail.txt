HOUSTON —  Sandra Bland's family is asking a judge to reject arguments from Texas that state Department of Public Safety reports related to the black woman's arrest, jailing and death last summer should be withheld from them.Texas says it has immunity from damages sought in a lawsuit Bland's family filed after she died in a county jail three days after a contentious traffic stop.The state's lawyers also contend police records can be withheld under a "law enforcement privilege" that protects files in an ongoing investigation.The latest motion was filed Friday.The trooper who arrested the Chicago-area woman is charged with perjury for allegedly lying when he claimed in an affidavit that Bland was "combative and uncooperative" after he pulled her over.A medical examiner ruled Bland's death a suicide.
