NEWS WATCH: SECURITY
NEWS WATCH: SECURITY; Stopping Hackers, While Doing Detective Work on the Side


By J. D. Biersdorfer


Published: March 7, 2002









                    Worrying about hackers and viruses is becoming a way of life for Windows users, but Macintosh owners should not assume they are immune to Internet ills. For them, Symantec has announced Version 2 of its Norton Personal Firewall for Macintosh ($69.95 or $39.95 for an upgrade). The program is also available ($99.95 or $69.95 for the upgrade) in the larger Norton Internet Security suite, which includes Norton Anti-Virus and Aladdin's iClean clutter-reducing software.        

                    Symantec has also updated its Norton Utilities and Norton AntiVirus software, along with its SystemWorks suite. The updated programs include versions written specifically for Mac OS X and separate versions for Mac OS 8.1 to OS 9. (Details can be found at www.symantec.com/mac.)        

                    For Windows users, the company has added a tracing service to its Security Check Web site (www.symantec.com/securitycheck). Users alerted to a potential hacker intrusion from their firewall software can go to the site, type in the Internet Protocol address number of the intruding machine from the firewall alert and see on a map where the attack originated. The site can identify the Internet service provider of the intruder, making it easier to complain to his system administrator.   J. D. Biersdorfer
