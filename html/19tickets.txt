Two men pleaded guilty to conspiring to evade computer security by buying and reselling more than a million seats for events  like  the Rose Bowl football game.The men, Kenneth Lowson, 41, and Kristofer Kirsch, 37, admitted in federal court in Newark  that they made more than $25 million in profits by cutting ahead of the public to buy through Ticketmaster  and other vendors.Wiseguy Tickets sidestepped technology known as Captcha, which required users to read, then retype, distorted images of letters and numbers to buy tickets. By doing so, the defendants sped up the purchasing process, prosecutors said. Among the premium tickets they bought included almost half of the 440 best general admission floor seats to a July 2008 concert by Bruce Springsteen at Giants Stadium.Mr. Lowson and Mr. Kirsch, both of Los Angeles,  were co-owners of Wiseguy Tickets. A computer programmer for the company, Joel Stevenson, 37, of Alameda, Calif., also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor.Under a plea deal, Mr. Lowson and Mr. Kirsch face up to two years in prison. Mr. Stevenson faces  up to a year in prison. United States District Judge Katharine Hayden set sentencing for March 15.
