 Microsoft yesterday rolled out new versions of its dominant desktop programs, Windows and Office, beginning a series of new offerings that the company will introduce over the next year to combat a rising challenge from Internet-based software.

But When Will It Be Installed?






The products, led by Windows Vista and Office 2007, are being made available immediately to business customers, but they will not arrive in the consumer market until after the holiday shopping season, on Jan. 30. Vista has suffered repeated delays, coming five years after the previous version of the Windows operating system, a lengthy gap Microsoft has vowed will not happen again.At a marketing event for businesses held in New York, Microsoft emphasized not only its desktop products, but also how they will work with its server software to increase productivity by making it easier for workers to collaborate in online teams, retrieve and reply to e-mail messages by phone using voice-recognition software, and easily search for information inside their laptop or across their corporation.This is by far the biggest wave of products weve ever introduced, said Steven A. Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft.Some customers have been working with early, or beta, copies of Windows Vista and Office 2007, for several months now. A few of them appeared with Mr. Ballmer yesterday to discuss the advantages of the new products  like improved 3-D graphics and better security in Vista, and collaboration abilities in Office.PC makers, software developers and others who rely on Microsofts Windows technology were disappointed by the delay past the holiday season in the consumer market, and their sales will most likely suffer this year.Yet the next Windows and Office cycle of buying is now on the horizon, and they are positioning themselves for advantage. Dell, for example, has stumbled over the last year. But it is strongest in the corporate market and it hopes to benefit from helping business customers make the transition to Windows Vista and Office 2007 relatively quickly and inexpensively. This should work to Dells advantage, said Brad Anderson, a Dell senior vice president.In its new products, Microsoft is acknowledging the importance customers place on Internet-based software  a technology direction symbolized by  Google, which in addition to search is also offering other services, including Web-based document processing.The new wave of Microsoft offerings has been designed to find, view and link to blogs on the Internet, for example, and to use that technology with Microsoft products. We want to bring those innovations safely inside the corporation, Mr. Ballmer said.Microsoft also released new versions of two server products, Exchange Server 2007 and Office SharePoint Server 2007, which corporations have also been testing. The big gains for corporate customers, according to Mr. Ballmer, will come from using the new desktop and server software together. Its a Microsoft family of products, he said. And theres all this innovation thats coming behind the flagship products.Exchange is the server program behind Outlook, Microsofts desktop e-mail and communications software, which is part of the Office suite of products. SharePoint is a collaboration tool, which allows people to work together and jointly modify reports, project plans and other documents online.SharePoint is similar to Web software for collaboration, like wikis,  which are gaining in popularity inside companies. Eyeing the potential, Google recently bought a wiki start-up company called Jotspot.SharePoint is a collaboration tool, but one that is tied to the Office suite of productivity programs like Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook, which are familiar to hundreds of millions of workers.SharePoint, analysts say, is doing well within companies, which want to enhance collaboration and productivity, but may be reluctant to rely on a start-up or free software for technology.Thats a big lock-in factor and it helps Microsoft, at least for the next few years, said Michael Silver, an analyst at Gartner, a research firm.While many companies are experimenting with Web-based software and free versions of office-oriented programs, they do  not yet represent a real threat to Microsofts industry-dominant Windows and Office products, analysts say, at least not for another few years.This is a better Windows and a better Office, and there is no feasible alternative for most companies, said Jim Murphy, an analyst for AMR Research, a technology consulting firm. The testers of the new Microsoft products included the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, where the cancer research group is using Vista, Office and SharePoint to show 3-D images of protein molecules on the surface of cancer cells, let scientists worldwide look at them and share written research. The specialized application was built in two weeks. That simplicity is essential, and revolutionary, to help speed the pace of innovation in the kind of work we do, said Dr. Peter Kuhn, a cell biologist at the institute.Michael Wolf, chief executive of MTV Networks, said the new Microsoft products made it easier and faster for teams of writers in far-flung locations to make changes quickly on scripts for television programs, all working from their favored Office program. Our people are addicted to Outlook, Mr. Wolf said. Shaygan Kheradpir, the chief information officer of  Verizon, said the BitLocker feature in Vista, which allows for automatic data encryption, will ease his worries when company laptops are lost or stolen. Its a quantum jump in security and privacy, he said.Microsoft has long said that its toughest competitor in the personal computer operating system market is previous versions of its own Windows software. And corporations tend to move gradually to new operating systems, waiting a year or two after a new Windows version is released, as they test their internal software applications and write new ones tailored for the new Windows.But for most companies, its not a question of if, but when, Mr. Murphy of AMR Research said.
