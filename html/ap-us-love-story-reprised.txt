CAMBRIDGE, Mass. —  Actors Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal are returning to Harvard University more than 45 years after the release of their 1970 classic "Love Story."The duo, now in their 70s, will be reflecting on their careers Monday afternoon in a conversation moderated by arts journalist Alicia Anstead.MacGraw and O'Neal currently are co-starring in a national tour of "Love Letters," which is about a man and a woman who maintain contact over 50 years through notes, cards and letters.The play begins a one-week engagement at Boston's Citi Shubert Theatre Tuesday.The actors are expected to drive to Harvard in an antique MG convertible similar to the one featured in "Love Story."  That film was about a wealthy Harvard student who marries a less wealthy student over his parents' objections.
