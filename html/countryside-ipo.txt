LONDON — Countryside Properties, a British home builder that is majority-owned by the American private-equity firm Oaktree Capital Management, said on Monday that its initial public offering could value the company at 1.1 billion pounds, or about $1.6 billion.Countryside said it expected to price its offering between 225 pence and 275 pence a share, valuing the company at £1.125 billion at the midpoint of the range.“We look forward with confidence to the next stage of growth for Countryside as a publicly listed company,” Ian Sutcliffe, the Countryside chief executive, said in a news release.Countryside said it expected to raise about £114 million in the offering and to begin conditional trading on the London Stock Exchange on Feb. 12.The I.P.O. would be a return to the markets for Countryside, which first went public in London in 1972. Funds advised by Oaktree took a majority stake in the company in 2013, acquiring its stake from the Lloyds Banking Group.Countryside, which announced plans last month for an I.P.O., said it expected to use the proceeds to pay down its debt and to accelerate development at several housing sites.Entities controlled by Oaktree and members of Countryside’s management and employees would sell shares in the offering.Countryside, based in Brentwood, England, develops residential homes and mixed-use communities, primarily operating in the London area and in the southeast, the east and the northwest of England. The company, which was founded in 1958, posted revenue of £615.8 million in its 2015 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30.JPMorgan Chase, Barclays and Numis Securities are acting as underwriters on the offering.
