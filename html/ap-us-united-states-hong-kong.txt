WASHINGTON —  The U.S. says the disappearance of five Hong Kong residents associated with a publisher specializing in books banned in mainland China raises serious questions about Beijing's commitments to the territory's autonomy.State Department spokesman John Kirby urged China on Monday to clarify the status of all five individuals and let them to return home.The five residents are associated with Mighty Current Media and the Causeway Bay Bookstore. They have disappeared since October from mainland China or Thailand.They include British citizen and chief editor Lee Bo. The circumstances of Lee's case have fueled suspicions Chinese security agents crossed into Hong Kong to abduct him in breach of the "one country, two systems" principle the communist mainland promised to uphold after taking control of the city from Britain in 1997.
