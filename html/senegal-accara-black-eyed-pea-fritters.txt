Not far from the Place des Vosges in Paris, on a side street called the Rue Elzévir, there is a restaurant called Le Petit Dakar. It’s where I first tasted thieboudienne, the soul-warming national dish of Senegal, a rich, spicy and deeply flavored mix of rice, vegetables and fish. I loved the complexity of the dish and the atmosphere of the place. It made me want to hop the next plane to Dakar.I still haven’t made that visit to Senegal, but my interest in its cuisine has been reignited lately as I cook my way through the chef Pierre Thiam’s latest book, “Senegal: Modern Senegalese Recipes From the Source to the Bowl.”For years, Mr. Thiam, who grew up in Dakar, had a restaurant in Brooklyn called Le Grand Dakar, which became a cultural gathering spot for West African New Yorkers. While he obviously cherishes the traditional comfort foods of his youth in Senegal, he likes to bring in bright elements from elsewhere: Asia, North Africa, the Middle East and Brooklyn.

His recipe for deep-fried black-eyed pea fritters, called accara, is a good example. Throughout West Africa, accara are a street-food snack served with a smear of kani, a fiery scotch-bonnet pepper sauce. For a more substantial meal, the accara are stuffed into a baguette with tomato, lettuce and onion.

Mr. Thiam, noting the fritters’ similarity to falafel, makes his accara sandwich in pita bread instead. He replaces the kani sauce with a Vietnamese-style spicy carrot pickle he learned to make from his Vietnamese godfather.

The accara are absolutely delicious and easy to make. The only fiddly bit is rubbing the skins off the black-eyed peas (soaking them in hot water helps). The batter is quickly made in a food processor, then spoonfuls of it are shallow-fried. And while they do look a bit like falafel (made from ground chickpeas), they taste much lighter and noticeably, delectably beanier.

Whether you eat them hot as cocktail tidbits or put them on a bun, make sure you have something spicy to go with them (the spicier the better), whether it’s his pickled carrots, a hot green chutney or a dab of Tunisian harissa.Recipes: Spicy Pickled Carrots | Black-Eyed Pea Fritters
