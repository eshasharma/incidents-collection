BRUSSELS —  European Council President Donald Tusk says negotiations on Britain's proposals for a changed relationship with the European Union have made "good progress" and he will table a draft agreement Tuesday.But Tusk tweeted Monday that there were still "outstanding issues."On Sunday, Tusk and British Prime Minister David Cameron met inconclusively, but agreed to extend talks over a 24-hour period.Officials hope all 28 EU states can reach a pact at a Feb. 18-19 summit. Britain is due to hold a referendum on its EU membership by 2017, and possibly as early as June.A sticking point has been Cameron's desire to limit British welfare benefits to migrants from other EU countries. Other EU leaders say that undermines the key EU principle of free movement.
