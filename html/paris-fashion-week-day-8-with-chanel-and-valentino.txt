PARIS — Tuesday may be the penultimate stretch — with just 36 hours to go until the end of the fall 2016 season — but it holds some big-name shows.At 10:30 the curtain will rise on what is unquestionably the most lavish spectacle of the week, the Chanel show at the Grand Palais. Packed to the brim with celebrities and the world’s wealthiest women, the vast space will have been transformed into whatever whim has taken the fancy of Karl Lagerfeld, Chanel’s creative director. Previous seasons have included a sprawling casino, a supermarket and an airport waiting lounge.Two hours later, Vanessa Seward, a staple for chic Parisian women, shows her latest collection, before an en masse turnout for Valentino in the Jardin des Tuileries.
