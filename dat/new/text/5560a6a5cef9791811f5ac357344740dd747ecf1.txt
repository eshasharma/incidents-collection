"The News of the World is in the business of holding others to account. But it failed when it came to itself." Officials at the newspaper first believed that the voice mail hacking activities, first discovered in 2006, were confined to one reporter, Murdoch wrote."We now have voluntarily given evidence to the police that I believe will prove that this was untrue and those who acted wrongly will have to face the consequences," Murdoch added.There are two ongoing police investigations into the voice mail hacking allegations, Murdoch said.The newspaper closure comes as companies come under increased scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe for alleged tech-related privacy violations. Starting in 2010, Google faced investigations for Wi-Fi snooping by its Street View cars, and in recent months, privacy groups have raised concerns about how much geo-location data is collected smartphones running Google and Apple operating systems. Privacy groups have also complained about the amount of personal data that websites and advertising networks are collecting.Grant Gross covers technology and telecom policy in the U.S. government for The IDG News Service.
