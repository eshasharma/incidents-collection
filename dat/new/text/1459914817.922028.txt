Stagefright 2: all versions of Android since 2010 hit by privacy-busting flaw

Stagefright, the hugely widespread Android vulnerability which Google finally patched in early August, is back for a second go.
Security research firm Trend Micro has discovered a new vulnerability in how videos are handled in Android, which they warn can allow a hacker to run their own code on mobile devices.
Like the flaw in Stagefright, the attack works on nearly every version of Android still in use, from 2010s version 2.3 all the way to Aprils version 5.1.1. As with Stagefright, the researchers have waited for Google to release a patch before announcing their discovery. And as with Stagefright, the patch is not yet available for end-users, because it takes weeks to filter down through the handset ecosystem.
Trend Micros Wish Wu says: With this new vulnerability, an attacker would be able to run their code with the same permissions that the mediaserver program already has as part of its normal routines.
Since the mediaserver component deals with a lot of media-related tasks including taking pictures, reading MP4 files, and recording videos, the privacy of the victim may be at risk. Devices with customised versions of Android but with no modification made to the media server component are also affected.
