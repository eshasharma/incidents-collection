Attack the Messenger: Jane Mayers Dark Money, about the influence of wealthy families in conservative politics, hits the hardcover nonfiction list at No.5. Mayers book has made news partly for its revelation that even as she was investigating the Koch brothers, they seemed to be investigating her: Dirt, dirt, dirt, one source told Mayer, describing the mission a team of operatives had to smear her name after The New Yorker published her first long article about the Kochs political efforts. (Mayer goes where the facts take her: She had previously written a similar article about George Soross influence on liberal causes.) Its uncommon for a private detective to be hired to conduct a retaliatory investigation into a reporters character, she writes in the book, adding that although its unclear how directly involved they were, clues leading back to the Kochs were everywhere.That effort didnt pan out  an attempt to accuse Mayer of plagiarism proved meritless  but the intimidation tactics werent especially surprising to another writer familiar with the Kochs: Daniel Schulman, whose biography of the brothers, Sons of Wichita, was a best seller in 2014. Im not sure if the Koch brothers hired anyone to dig up information on me, but I wouldnt be surprised if they backgrounded me pretty thoroughly, Schulman told me via email. After reporting in depth on the bare-knuckled tactics the brothers used against each other during the decade-plus of litigation that played out between them  including allegedly hiring Dumpster-diving private investigators  it seemed wise to be very cautious. For instance, I didnt throw away a shred of paper related to the book. I held on to everything and eventually dumped a big garbage bag full of old drafts and scribblings into a campfire.Still Writing: Danielle Steels new novel, Blue, debuts at the top of the hardcover fiction list, so this seems as good a time as any to revisit a blog post Steel wrote three years ago that was so popular the traffic crashed her website. As you all know, now and then I air my pet peeves, she began. There is a phenomenon that I have encountered for a long time, years, which I always take personally. ... It goes like this: I run into a man I know or meet at a dinner party for the first time in a long time. After hello, they open with, So, are you still writing? Hmmm. This immediately suggests to me that they have not read The New York Times (best-seller list) in many years, The Wall Street Journal, or maybe they dont read at all. Yes, I am still writing. What this does is that it immediately puts my writing into the category as a hobby. As in, Are you still taking piano lessons, doing macram, have a parrot? I dont have a huge ego about my work, but lets face it, for me it is a job. A job I love, and I have been doing it since I was 19 years old. ... Yes, for heavens sake, I am still writing.
