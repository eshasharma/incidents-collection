                    david burnham is a reporter in the times's washington bureau. this article is adapted from mr. burnham's book ''the rise of the computer state,'' to be published by random house in may.        

                    a federal court of appeals recently ruled that the largest and most secretive intelligence agency of the united states, the national security agency, may lawfully intercept the overseas communications of americans even if it has no reason to believe they are engaged in illegal activities. the ruling, which also allows summaries of these conversations to be sent to the federal bureau of investigation, significantly broadens the already generous authority of the n.s.a.  to keep track of american citizens.        

                    the decision by the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit involves the government surveillance of abdeen jabara, a michigan-born lawyer who for many years has represented arab-american citizens and alien residents, and reverses a 1979 ruling that the n.s.a.'s acquisition of jabara's overseas messages violated his fourth amendment right to be free of ''unreasonable searches and seizures.'' even while refusing the plaintiff's request for reconsideration, the court curiously acknowledged the far-reaching nature of the case, recognizing that the n.s.a.'s interception of overseas telecommunications and their dissemination to ''other federal agencies has great potential for abuse.'' the court, however, held that the problem was ''a policy matter that lies in the domain of the executive or legislative branch of our government.''        

                    the n.s.a. is much more than a massive computerized funnel that collects, channels and sorts information for the president and such organizations as the central intelligence agency and f.b.i. the national security agency, an arm of the defense department but under the direct command of the director of central intelligence, is an electronic spying operation, and its leverage is based on a massive bank of what are believed to be the largest and most advanced computers now available to any bureaucracy in the world: computers to break codes, direct spy satellites, intercept electronic messages, recog- nize target words in spoken communications and store, organize and index all of it.        

                    over the years, this virtually unknown federal agency has repeatedly sought to enlarge its power without consulting the civilian officials who theoretically direct the government, while it also has sought to influence the operation and development of all civilian communications networks. indeed, under vice adm. bobby ray inman, n.s.a. director from 1977 to 1981, the agency received an enlarged presidential mandate to involve itself in communications issues, and successfully persuaded private corporations and institutions to cooperate with it.        

                    yet over the three decades since the n.s.a. was created by a classified executive order signed by president truman in 1952, neither the congress nor any president has publicly shown much interest in grappling with the far-reaching legal conflicts surrounding the operation of this extraordinarily powerful and clandestine agency. a senate committee on intelligence, warning that the n.s.a.'s capabilities impinged on crucial issues of privacy, once urged that congress or the courts develop a legislative or judicial framework to control the agency's activities. in a nation whose constitution demands an open government operating according to precise rules of fairness, the n.s.a. remains an unexamined entity.  with the increasing computerization of society, the conflicts it presents become more important.  the power of the n.s.a., whose annual budget and staff are believed to exceed those of either the f.b.i. or the c.i.a., is enhanced by its unique legal status within the federal government. unlike the agriculture department, the postal service or even the c.i.a., the n.s.a. has no specific congressional law defining its responsibilities and obligations. instead, the agency, based at fort george meade, about 20 miles northeast of washington, has operated under a series of presidential directives. because of congress's failure to draft a law for the agency, because of the tremendous secrecy surrounding the n.s.a.'s work and because of the highly technical and thus thwarting character of its equipment, the n.s.a.  is free to define and pursue its own goals.        

                    despite the impenetrable secrecy surrounding the agency - no public briefings or access to its premises is allowed - its mission was first discussed openly in the 1975 hearings of the senate select committee to study government operations with respect to intelligence activities. various aspects of the agency's responsibilities also have been touched upon in a handful of depositions filed by the agency in federal courts, several recent executive orders and a few aging documents found in the towering stacks of the national archives.        

                    according to these sources, the n.s.a. has two broad goals, one offensive, one defensive. first, the agency aggressively monitors international communications links searching for ''foreign intelligence,'' intercepting electronic messages as well as signals generated by radar or missile launchings. second, the agency prevents foreign penetration of communications links carrying information bearing on ''national security.''
